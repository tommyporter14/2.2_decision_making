# 2.2_decision_making

Here is my 2.2 decision making lab. The goal of this lab was to take a user input number between 1 - 100 
and then verify it based on odd/even and speicifc ranges. The output text is specific to the instructions I was given 
based on those conditions. If the number is negative or over 100 it should notify the user and ask them if they want to coninue.
It also should ask them if they want to continue after every number entered has been anylized. Fianlly the program also asks the user 
for their name. If you have any questions feel free to reach out!
